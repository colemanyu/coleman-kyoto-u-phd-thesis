are not consistently used.
[] Change the title to a more specific one

Hi Coleman-san,

Thank you for the draft.

At the current moment,
I have the following comments.

(1) format
It seems that the format is too sparse.
It may give a bad impression to the examiners.
(They may think that you have used too sparse format
to make the paper longer than 100 pages.)
More dense format should be used (but the length
should be more than 100 pages).

(2) capital/lower case letters
Capital/lower case letters in Section titles
are not consistently used.

(3) Title
The title seems to be too general.
I think that it should be more specific.

If you do want to use the current title,
the Japanese title should be:

時系列分析とその生命情報学への応用

(4) two parts ==> three parts
In Abstract, Introduction, Conclusion etc.
you wrote that there are two main points (aspects, contributions, etc)
in the thesis, but this is inappropriate.
In particular, one examiner requires three results,
so all should be revised to three.

(5) Chapter 2
It is strange that there is no figure.
Some figures should be provided.

(6) Section 2.2.1
It may not be appropriate to use ED to denote Euclidean Distance
because in many cases ED is used to denote the edit distance.

Furthermore Eq. (2.1) is more general than Euclidean Distance
(it is L_p norm).

(6) Section titles
Some section titles should be changed as below
(in order to avoid overlap with Chapter titles).
3.5 Conclusion ==> Concluding Remarks
4.1 Introduction ==> Background
4.6 Conclusion and Future Work ==> Concluding Remarks

(7) References
Author names are not consistently used.
(For example, see [5] vs. [6].)

Such words as DNA, SVM, DTW in the paper titles should
be given in the capital letters.


Best wishes,

Tatsuya Akutsu
