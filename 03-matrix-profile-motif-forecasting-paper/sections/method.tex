\begin{definition}[Time series]
    A \textit{time series} $T = t_1, t_2, \dots, t_n$ is a sequence of real-valued numbers with length = $n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Subsequence]
    A \textit{subsequence} $T_{i, m} = t_i, t_{i+1}, \dots, t_{i+m-1}$ of a $T$ is a sequence that consists of a continuous subset of the entries from $T$ of length $m$ starting from $i$.
\end{definition}
A sequence with length $= m$ is denoted as $m$-sequence.

\begin{definition}[Distance profile]
    A \textit{distance profile} $D_i = d_{i, 1}, d_{i, 2}, \dots, d_{i, n-m+1}$ of a $T$ is a vector of the Euclidean distances between a given subsequence $T_{i, m}$ and each subsequences in $T$, where $d_{i, j}$ is the distance between $T_{i, m}$ and $T_{j, m}$, $1 \leq i, j \leq n-m+1$.
\end{definition}
The distances are measured between z-normalized time series.


\begin{definition}[Matrix profile]
    A \textit{matrix profile} $P = \min(D_1), \min(D_2), \dots, $\\$\min(D_{n-m+1})$ of $T$ is a vector of Euclidean distances between every subsequence $T_{i, m}$ of $T$ and its nearest neighbor in $T$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Matrix profile index]
    A \textit{matrix profile index} $I = I_1, I_2, \dots, I_{n-m+1}$ of $T$ is a vector of integers, where $I_i = j$ if $d_{i, j} = \min{D_i}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Left distance profile]
    A \textit{left distance profile} $D_i^L = d_{i, 1}, d_{i, 2}, \dots,\allowbreak d_{i, i - \ceil{m/4} -1}$ of $T$ is a vector of Euclidean distances between a given subsequence $T_{i, m}$ and each subsequence that appears before $T_{i, m}$.
    To note, $i - \ceil{m/4} - 1$ is the index location of the last eligible subsequence before $T_{i, m}$ because of the exclusion zone.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Left matrix profile]
    A \textit{left matrix profile} $P^L = \min(D_1^L), \min(D_2^L), \allowbreak  \dots, \min(D_{n-m+1}^L)$ of $T$ is a vector of Euclidean distances between every subsequence $T_{i, m}$ of $T$ and its nearest neighbor in $T$ before it.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Left matrix profile index]
    A \textit{left matrix profile index} $I^L = I_1^L, I_2^L, \dots, I_{n-m+1}^L$ of $T$ is a vector of integers, where $I_i^L = j$ if $d_{i, j} = \min{D_i^L}$.
\end{definition}
