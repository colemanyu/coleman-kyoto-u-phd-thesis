The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/colemanyu/matrix-profile-motif-forecasting}.
In this study, we focus on univariate time series forecasting.
There is only one single target variable $Y$.
We predict the future of $Y$ only based on the past of it.
The dataset used is listed in Table~\ref{tab:dataset_statistics}.
For each time series $T$ in the dataset, it is split into two contiguous time series, namely $T_\mathrm{train} = T(1:\mathrm{split})$ and $ T_\mathrm{test} = T(\mathrm{split+1:|T|})$, where $\mathrm{split}$ defines the training-test split, which is shown in the column 6 in Table~\ref{tab:dataset_statistics}.
To note, the $N$ time series in a dataset are considered as multiple, independent unvariate time series instead of a multivaraite time series with channels $= N $.
The original covariates are constructed from the timestamp information.
The settings of $w$ and $h$ are adopted from the original corresponding papers~\cite{elsayed2021we}.
It is not necessary for them to be the same.

We first report the experimental results of not using any covariates derived from the nearest neighbors.
The experimental results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:results_without_covariates} and Table~\ref{tab:results_with_covariates}.
