\caption{Flattening a 2D window of size $(1 + M) \times w$ to a 1D vector of length $w + M$. The resulting vector serves as the \textit{predictor} for the regressor. Its expected \textit{response} is the vector of length $h$. The regressor learns from this predictor-response pair. We also call the regressor a forecaster because it aims to forecast.}
