\caption{The left (right) matrix profile and the matrix profile of a time series. The matrix profile shows the distances between each $m$-subsequence and its nearest neighbor.
The left (right) matrix profile shows the same information but is limited to its left (right) nearest neighbor.
For a particular $m$-subsequence shown by the right gray box, its nearest neighbor is the left gray box, as shown in the left matrix profile and the matrix profile.
The first (last) point in each box is denoted by a red circle (triangle).
$l$ denotes the length of the subsequent subsequence of the nearest neighbor.
Intuitively, this subsequence should be similar to the subsequent (i.e., future) subsequence of the right gray box.
To note, the left (right) matrix profile starts (ends) at a later (earlier) index because the corresponding nearest neighbors with length $m$ do not exist.
